Here is some of codes generated in Python using Machine Learning and AI for generating prediction in Stock Prices. 

Packages Used: 
* Talib
* Scikit Learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Pandas
* Numpy and numexpr (Faster Numpy for better performance)
* Visualisation tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib

Still Working... Will keep on updating...

**LSTMs** have gave me promosing results and now I am exploring advance LSTM like MD-LSTM and MiD-LSTM for better prediction and more feature inclusion.

Here is result one of my project done for Sentiment Analysis on News and LSTM with RNN.

Below is Prediction for NASDAQ using our model. Price is scaled to 1. Trained the model for past 2 years and predicted the results for 200 days in the future.
